# Descriptive explanations for each feature

1.num_packets:

Benign: A normal number of packets corresponding to regular network communication.
Ransomware: An unusually high number of packets, possibly indicating a rapid and aggressive attempt to communicate or propagate.

2.avg_packet_len:

Benign: Packets of varying lengths, typical of regular network traffic.
Ransomware: Packets with consistent, potentially larger lengths, suggesting the transfer of encoded or encrypted payloads.

3.num_tcp_packets:

Benign: A balanced mix of TCP and other protocol packets.
Ransomware: A high number of TCP packets, especially if it dominates other protocols, indicating potential malicious communication.

4.num_udp_packets:

Benign: Occasional UDP packets for common applications.
Ransomware: A surge in UDP packets, signaling potential use for fast, lightweight communication, a characteristic of ransomware.

5.num_ipv4_packets:

Benign: Expected IPv4 traffic consistent with standard network operations.
Ransomware: A dominance of IPv4 packets, especially if combined with other suspicious patterns.

6.num_ipv6_packets:

Benign: Minimal IPv6 packets in a typical network.
Ransomware: An unusual presence of IPv6 packets, potentially indicating advanced or targeted behavior.

7.num_unique_src_ports:

Benign: A varied mix of source ports reflecting diverse communication sources.
Ransomware: A concentration on specific source ports, suggesting focused or malicious communication.

8.num_unique_dst_ports:

Benign: A diverse set of destination ports reflecting normal network services.
Ransomware: A focus on specific destination ports, indicative of potential ransomware-related activities.

9.num_flows:

Benign: A reasonable number of flows representing regular communication patterns.
Ransomware: A high number of flows with distinct patterns, signaling potential malicious activity.

10.avg_flow_size:

Benign: Moderate flow sizes indicating regular data exchanges.
Ransomware: Larger flow sizes, especially irregular patterns, suggesting potential data exfiltration or ransomware-related activities.

11.num_http_packets:

Benign: Occasional HTTP packets for web-based communication.
Ransomware: An elevated count of HTTP packets, indicating potential ransomware communication with command and control servers.

12.num_https_packets:

Benign: Regular HTTPS packets for secure web communication.
Ransomware: An increased count of HTTPS packets, potentially encrypted ransomware traffic.

13.num_dns_packets:

Benign: Expected DNS packets for domain resolution.
Ransomware: An increased count of DNS packets, potentially indicating attempts to resolve malicious domains.

14.min_interarrival_time:

Benign: Consistent interarrival times between packets.
Ransomware: Rapid, closely spaced packets with minimal interarrival times, suggesting automated or malicious behavior.

15.max_interarrival_time:

Benign: Occasional longer gaps between packets.
Ransomware: Unusually long interarrival times, potentially indicating slow communication to evade detection.

16.avg_interarrival_time:

Benign: A moderate average interarrival time between packets.
Ransomware: Significant variations in interarrival times, indicative of irregular communication patterns.

17.source_ip:

Benign: The source IP address of a regular network device.
Ransomware: An unfamiliar or suspicious source IP address, potentially indicating a threat.

18.destination_ip:

Benign: The destination IP address of a known and trusted network entity.
Ransomware: An unknown or potentially malicious destination IP address.

19.file_types:

Benign: Common file types associated with regular web traffic.
Ransomware: Unusual or suspicious file types transferred over HTTP, potentially indicating malicious payloads.


20.Payload Entropy: Measure the entropy of the payload data in each packet.

High Entropy (Random-Looking): Ransomware often encrypts files, resulting in encrypted payloads with high entropy.

Low Entropy (Structured): Benign traffic may have more structured and predictable payload patterns.
